<p>All of ChangeGear's modules easily interact with one another to provide 
 a full-featured ITIL service support solution. Information from the CMDB 
 is accessed from modules to allow the correct incident, problem, or change 
 request to be associated with the appropriate CI. Information from the 
 ticket module is transported to problem and RFC tickets without having 
 to retype information such as the summary, user information, etc.</p>
<p>The main inter-operability features of ChangeGear include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Promotion</p></li>
	<li><p>Notification Rules</p></li>
	<li><p>Business Policy Automations</p></li>
	<li><p>Communication Templates</p></li>
	<li><p>Accessible CI Information</p></li>
	<li><p>Consistent User Information</p></li>
</ul>
<p />
<h3><a id="Promotion"></a>Promotion</h3>
<p>Work flows between tickets are also integrated with each other for consistent 
 communication between all concerned parties. When a ticket is promoted, 
 it enters a special life cycle state that indicates that it is waiting 
 on the promoted ticket to be resolved. Incidents and service requests 
 enter the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pending Resolution</span> state, 
 and problems enter the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pending Change</span> 
 state when promoted.</p>
<p>For example, if an incident or incidents have been identified as reporting 
 a potential problem, the incidents are promoted to a problem. The incident 
 ticket enters the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pending Resolution</span> 
 state after it has been promoted to a problem via the Promotion dialog. 
 After the problem enters the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pending 
 Close</span> state, the state of the incident ticket changes to <span style="font-weight: bold;">In-Progress</span> OR a service request 
 enters the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fulfillment</span> state. 
 An incident or service request can be promoted directly to an RFC if the 
 assignee has sufficient privileges. The state of the incident or service 
 request will change similarly.</p>
<p>A problem that requires a change to be successfully resolved undergoes 
 similar work flow changes. After the problem has been promoted to 
 an RFC, the ticket enters the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pending 
 Change</span> state. When the RFC is closed, either successfully 
 or unsuccessfully, the ticket enters the <span style="font-weight: bold;">In-Progress</span> 
 state. If incidents or service requests are related to a problem 
 via promotion, when the problem enters the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pending 
 Close</span> state, the incident enters the <span style="font-weight: bold;">In-Progress</span> 
 state, OR the service request enters the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fulfillment</span> 
 state.</p>
<p />
<h3>Notification Rules</h3>
<p>ChangeGear can be configured to send notification e-mails to appropriate 
 parties when the state of the ticket changes. For example, a notification 
 can be sent to the original requester and the incident assignee when a 
 promoted ticket reaches the Pending Close state. This alerts the assignee 
 that action is required on the original ticket and reassures the original 
 requester that progress is being made on the ticket. The content of the 
 notification can be completely automated using communication templates. 
 (See the Routing and Notification section in the ChangeGear Desktop 
 help document under Administration.)</p>
<p />
<h3>Business Policy Automations</h3>
<p>ChangeGear uses Business Policy Automations (BPAs) to perform actions 
 when certain criteria are met. For example, when a ticket reaches a certain 
 state or when a ticket has been in a state for a certain period of time, 
 an e-mail can be sent to recipients to notify them of the state of the 
 ticket. A ticket that has been in the Pending Close state for more than 
 72 hours could be automatically closed, or a ticket that has been In-Progress 
 for more than a week could be escalated to a manager. If a ticket has 
 not been accepted within a certain amount of time, possibly due to absence, 
 the ticket could be reassigned to another person or role. As for Notification 
 Rules, e-mail notifications triggered by such rules can be completely 
 automated using communication templates. (See the Business Policy Automation 
 section in the ChangeGear Desktop help document under Administration for 
 more information.)</p>
<p />
<h3>Communication Templates</h3>
<p>Communication Templates provide a consistent, unified, and automated 
 method of conveying information to stakeholders. Different template types 
 can be created for use with specific modules. Fields are used within the 
 template to provide dynamic text based on the kind of information available 
 to the specific type of template. For example, you can use a communication 
 template and notification rules such that when a problem ticket enters 
 the Pending Change state you can include ticket fields on the template 
 for the ticket description and notes fields and provide feedback to the 
 requester. (See the Business Policy Automation section in the ChangeGear 
 Desktop help document under Administration for more information.)</p>
<p />
<h3>Accessible CI Information</h3>
<p>Information about CIs is available in all ticket entry forms so that 
 an assignee has relevant information about the affected resources to more 
 efficiently resolve the ticket. Requests for change, as they deal with 
 modifying a CI, are recorded in the CI information whenever an RFC lists 
 a CI as an impacted resource. For example, information about an 
 e-mail server is readily available for all ticket types. When an RFC is 
 made against the e-mail server, the RFC information is recorded in the 
 CI.</p>
<p />
<h3>Consistent User Information</h3>
<p>ChangeGear has a single source of user data that is propagated throughout 
 the application. Every ChangeGear module has the same user profile 
 information regardless of the module in use. Users can view their information 
 via a My Profile link and notify the administrator of any information 
 which should be corrected, thus keeping the information up-to-date and 
 reducing errors. If a user manually enters different data on a ticket, 
 such as an incident ticket, that information is carried over if the ticket 
 requires promotion to a problem or RFC.</p>
