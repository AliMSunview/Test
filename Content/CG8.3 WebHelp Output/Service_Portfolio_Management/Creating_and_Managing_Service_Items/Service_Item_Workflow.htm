  <h2><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Service Item Workflow</span></h2>
  <p><span>A service item (or service offering) is a discrete service that your organization provides to its users. For example, a service item may be<span><![CDATA[ ]]> </span><i>New Hire</i>, which includes all the information and forms necessary to hire a new employee.
 Another example is<span><![CDATA[ ]]> </span><i>Voicemail Setup</i>, which includes all the information and forms necessary to fulfill the work item.<span><![CDATA[ ]]> </span></span>Service items may consist of other service items. For example, the<span><![CDATA[ ]]> </span><i>New Hire</i><span><![CDATA[ ]]> </span>service
 item may include links to other service items for setting up an e‐mail account, equipment requisition, voicemail setup, etc.</p>
  <p>Service items typically go through a life cycle that starts with service analysis and design and flows through operations and finally ends with service retirement. The ChangeGear Service Portfolio uses a workflow that tracks this life cycle. Service
 Items go through a design and approval pipeline before becoming operational and published in the Service Catalog.</p>
  <p>Below is a list of the workflow states and their descriptions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Design - services that are being planned, analyzed or designed. These can be new services, or existing services that are being re-designed.</li>
    <li>Review - services that are out of the design state and waiting to be approved for operation.</li>
    <li>Approved - services that have been approved but are not yet operational.</li>
    <li>Operational - services that are in operation, but not yet published in the service catalog. This could be during a soft launch of a service, for example.</li>
    <li>Published - services that are operational and published in the Service Catalog.</li>
    <li>Retired - services that are no longer being offered and are not in the pipeline to become operational again.</li>
    <li>Rejected - services that were rejected before they became operational. (Note: typically a previously operational service that is no longer needed should be Retired, not Rejected).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At any point in the workflow, the service item can be assigned to the desired person or team responsible for managing the item while in the current state.</p>
  <p>Use the date fields for indicating future milestones for a service item: planned operational date, planned publish date, planned retire date. Associated reports help administrators plan for service rollouts and retirement. These reports also help track
 service items that are overdue for planned changes.</p>
